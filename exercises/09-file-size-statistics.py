Here, we'll try something a little different. I've included data in
data/file_sizes:
    chx.txt
    cms-pil2m.txt
    cms-pil300.txt

    Each of these is the amount of data generated (in bytes) per day for each
    beamline.

    Try to, if you can:
        1. Read in the data, the first column as a datetime object, and the
        second as a float
        Try to obtain and plot these statistics:
            a. plot the data usage versus day
            b. sum the data each week and plot the data usage each week
            c. sum the data to get a data usage versus month for each

    Try your best, and feel free to ask me questions. The results of these
    plots will be a beginning of figures we can include in your poster. :-)
